# Nonogram

[Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) are a type of Math puzzles that I like to do in spare time. The basic idea is to reconstruct 2D image (2 or more color channels) from the set of vectors describing sequence of pixels in rows and columns. There are implementations online, but I decided to build my own, where I can input paper version of the puzzles I have and verify my solutions.

Things to do:
* Proof of concept (Matlab) - done, also shows the algorithm as animation.
* Rewriting it into more approachable language with better input options (Python/JS)
* Online implementation
* (Ideally) Developing image recognition engine that can reconstruct puzzles from photos of paper ones.
